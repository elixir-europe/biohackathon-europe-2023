## BioHackathon Europe
BioHackathon Europe brings people together from around the world to work on coding projects within life science. The event offers an intense week of hacking, with over 160 participants who work on diverse and exciting projects. The week starts with a half-day symposium to introduce these projects, and is followed by five days of hacking with one sole aim: coding to address problems in bioinformatics. 

## The 2023 BioHackathon
This year's event will take place 30 October - 3 November 2023 at Campus Belloch near Barcelona.
