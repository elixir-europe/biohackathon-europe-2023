<h2>Campus Belloch</h2>
<p>Campus Belloch is just 30 minutes from Barcelona, yet you will find yourself surrounded by greenery as far as the eye can see, thanks to a 200 hectare estate with a private park for relaxation.</p>
 <p>Surrounded by forests and forest nurseries, embraced by mountains and sea, it is only natural that the preservation of the environment is of special importance to the Campus: The minimalist architecture of the Campus works in harmony with its surroundings and has been designed with sustainability as the highest priority. </p>
<h3>Fun and entertainment activities</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Outside</strong> you can enjoy tennis, football, basketball, mountain biking and paddle.</li>
  <li><strong>Inside</strong> facilities offers gym, karaoke, table football, billiards, darts and board games.</li></ul>
